CROPWISE COMPANION (Your Digital Partner in Agricultural Excellence) 


PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Agriculture heavily relies on informed decision-making, and one crucial aspect is the proper selection of crops and fertilizers based on various factors. In contemporary agriculture, there exists a critical need for an integrated solution that recommends optimal crops, fertilizers and also assists farmers in improving soil health. Farmers often face challenges in optimizing their yield due to a lack of personalized guidance. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an Intelligent Crops and Fertilizer Recommendation System to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers while providing guidance on soil health improvement and plant disease detection with an integrated chatbot system.

ISSUES FACED BY THE FARMERS:

1.	Less demand due to high supply
2.	Fluctuating MSP (Minimum Selling Price)
3.	Over dependent on uncertain fertilizers
4.	Less return on investment
5.	Unpredictable Weather Conditions
   
This project is dedicated to tackling these pressing issues by implementing innovative solutions tailored to the needs of farmers, with the goal of stabilizing their income and increasing productive yields. By addressing these fundamental challenges, this project is poised to make a meaningful impact on the lives of farmers and the broader agricultural community.

VISION STATEMENT:

To revolutionize farming practices by providing personalized, predictive recommendations to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions, maximize yield potential and contribute to the advancement of sustainable agriculture globally.

MISSION STATEMENT:

To empower farmers with data driven insights and recommendations, leveraging their previous crop inputs, to optimize crop selection and fertilizer usage, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

UNIQUENESS OF THE PROJECT:

Personalized Recommendations: By considering farmers' inputs on their previous crop and geographic area, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to their specific circumstances. This individualized guidance can lead to better crop selection decisions and improved yields.

Utilization of Trend Analysis: By suggesting the most trending crops, the system helps farmers stay updated on market demands and emerging opportunities. This can enable farmers to capitalize on current market trends and potentially increase their profitability.

Field Suitability Assessment: By assessing the suitability of crops for farmers' fields, the system helps optimize resource allocation and minimize the risk of crop failure. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of planting crops in unsuitable conditions, leading to more efficient use of land and resources.

Fertilizer Optimization: By providing recommendations on the percentage of fertilizer to use, the system promotes efficient nutrient management. This can help farmers optimize their fertilizer usage, reduce input costs, and minimize environmental impact by preventing over-application.

Investor-Farmer Agreements: Cropwise Companion facilitates agreements between investors and farmers by providing a platform for communication and negotiation. Investors can browse the trending crops page to identify lucrative opportunities and initiate agreements with farmers through the website. Payment processing functionality is integrated into the platform to streamline financial transactions between parties.

In this page the farmer can select “Recommendation” button.
Then it shows a dropdown box which contains two options:
1.	Crop Recommendation
Utilizing machine learning algorithms trained on agricultural data, Cropwise Companion recommends suitable plant varieties based on factors such as soil type, climate conditions, and historical crop performance. This feature assists farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate for optimal yield.

2.	Fertilizer Recommendation
Cropwise Companion offers personalized fertilizer recommendations tailored to specific crop types and growth stages. By analyzing soil nutrient levels and crop requirements, this feature suggests the most appropriate fertilization strategies to maximize crop productivity and minimize waste.

CROP RECOMMENDATION PAGE
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a778909-3312-4fe8-a1bf-433064e43bb8)
 
In this page, the farmers input various parameters including soil NPK values, temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, the previous crop grown, and neighboring crops. Using this data, we utilize machine learning techniques called as random forest, with a crop recommendation dataset to suggest the most suitable crop for the farmer.
After entering the required values, the output will be:

In this page the investor can choose the “Like” Button.
When the investor selects this button, it indicates interest in that particular crop, reflecting the demand for the crop in that area. 
This information will be displayed on the trending crops  page, accessible to farmers, helping them choose crops to cultivate and stabilize their income.

TRENDING CROPS PAGE
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b306e953-76e3-4deb-b27c-62bb9ed581e7)
 

Here the farmers can view their location alongside the crops that are in high demand.
In this way this website empowers farmers to make crop choices using two methods:
1.	Crop recommendation system
2.	Trending crops page, offering a safer approach to stabilizing their income.
On the farmers' profile page, the investors also have the option to make agreements with the farmer.
When the investor clicks the "Make Agreement" button, they will be directed to the following page:

On this page, investors can make payments using PayPal or their debit/credit card.
 The investor will pay the advance amount to enable the farmer to begin cultivating the crop with necessary facilities. The remaining amount will be paid to the farmer later.
Another option for the investor is to send a message to the farmer through this website. 
The investor simply needs to enter their email ID in the designated section and then click "Done."
